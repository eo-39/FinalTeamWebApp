# IS601 - Final Project
## Project by Ebinehita Olumese and Sahar Qiyash

### This project is for a simple BMI Health Web-App API. It will provide users a database of Heights and Weights. The database will also showcase example BMI for each index. For user to access this page they need to login and verify their email address. We use POSTMAN to retrieve the BMI from table.
  - On the Home Page, users will have a database of different weights and heights, this serves as example 
  - On the BMI Calucaltor Page, users will have the ability to calucalate their own BMI and find out whether they meet the proper treshold regarding weight. 
  - Postman is used to retrieve BMI from the table.
